This work proposes deepfake detection method based on spatial convolutional visual
transformer (CViT), which improves the robustness and generalization limitations of existing
methods by utilizing the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the long-range dependency
capture capabilities of ViT. In this research, we further integrate a scaled dot-product attention
mechanism in the shallow layers of CNN to address the problem of shallow layer disappearing,
which is a common challenge for existing methods. Since the self-attention role aggregates
spatial information, our proposed approach preserves the most relevant textural features in the
image region to enhance and capture the interaction of features in the shallow layers and
preserve the disappearance of textural features in the shallow layers. The experiments
demonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our proposed method on
challenging CDF-DF datasets
